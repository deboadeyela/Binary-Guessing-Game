# Binary-Guessing-Game
An application that guesses what the user is thinking of based on a series of questions by building and using a binary tree. It manually builds an initial tree in which each internal node is a yes/no question. 

Yes goes to left side (left child), No goes to right side (right child).

Each leaf node in the tree is a guess. If the user arrives at a leaf node and the guess is wrong, the user is provided  with what the 
correct answer actually was and to provide a new yes/no question which can be added to the tree.

Example Results:
